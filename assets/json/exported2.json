card on this board should have a description where we put some thoughts in. If the description is somehow irritating or doesn't make sense at all, ask your domain lead or a team companion.\n\nLabels give an important indication on who should complete the task. As example:\n\n- New Starter : is a task for you\n- Staff: is a task for domain leads or HR/Ops\n- To be scheduled: is a task that needs to be scheduled by Staff\n- Scheduled: is a task that has already been scheduled \n- Self-service is a task you can complete on your own, also remotely\n\nIf you have any other questions don't hesitate to ask your team companion, domain lead or any of your colleagues. Everybody will be pleased to help you (or at least will refer you to someone who will 🙃). In case nobody is available at the time a question comes to your mind, just add a card with the question to this column.\n\nEvery feedback regarding this board is welcome anytime.
