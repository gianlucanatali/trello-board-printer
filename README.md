You can use this at this link: https://gianlucanatali.github.io/trello-board-printer/

## Running the samples locally

These samples should be executed inside a http server.

You can use whatever approach you prefer, I find this very handy:
https://gist.github.com/jgravois/5e73b56fa7756fd00b89#http-server-for-node

Just cd into this folder in your local system, and use

http-server ./trello-board-printer/ -p 1337
